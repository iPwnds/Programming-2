# Assignment

Say you want a string to be equal to either `abc` or `xyz`. These are the only two allowed possibilities.
For this, you'll need a new regex operator: `|`. Read the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) to find out how to use it.

Write a function `abc_or_xyz(string)` that checks whether `string` equals `abc` or `xyz`.
