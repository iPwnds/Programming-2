# Assignment

This should not come as a surprise... Write a function `ten_times_abc(string)` that checks whether `string` equals exactly ten consecutive `abc`s.

Luckily for you, regexes allow you to express you want a certain pattern to be repeated N times. The syntax for this is `x{N}`, where `x` is whatever you want repeated.
