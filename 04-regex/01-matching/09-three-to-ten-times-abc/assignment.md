# Assignment

Write a function `three_to_ten_times_abc(string)` that checks whether `string` consists of minimally three repetitions of `abc` and maximally ten repetitions.

As you saw in the last exercise, you can use `x{N}` to repeat `x` exactly N times. A variant of this construct allows you to specify a range. Look up in the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) what the syntax is.
