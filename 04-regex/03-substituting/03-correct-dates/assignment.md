# Assignment

Some foolish American lady wrote a long text but with all the dates wrong!
She used `2/1/2000` to refer to the first of February 2000, while the correct notation is of course `1/2/2000`.
This means we'll have to write a script that swaps around day and month in all dates.

Write a function `correct_dates(string)` that performs this task.
